## Notes

There are no `import` or `require` in reason-react. It will automatically look for the 
modules by name.

You need to add the folder that contains the `.re` files to be compiled in `bsconfig.json`:

```json
  "sources": ["src", "src/components"],
```

## Visual Studio Code error

    "reason.path.ocamlmerlin": "/Users/nick/.opam/system/bin/ocamlmerlin"
}
